Ubuntu Firefox Developer Edition Installer
================

This script installs and upgrades 64-bit Firefox Developer Edition on Ubuntu Linux systems using Mozilla's binaries, and sets it as the primary `firefox` executable.

Why?
----
The FF Dev Edition PPA is always slow to publish whenever a new 6-week cycle of development kicks off.  That, in addition to the fact that Canonical's Firefox builds are customized, made me put this script together.

What does it do?
----------------
This:

1. Closes all open instances of Firefox
2. Downloads the most recent x64 FF Dev Edition build
3. Installs it to /opt/firefox (creating a backup at /opt/firefox-old just in case something's wrong with that day's build)
4. Links the new instance of Firefox to the system Firefox's plugin directory.
5. Installs to /usr/local/bin/ which should mask the system/PPA `firefox` command.

You should be able to run this repeatedly without issue. If you encounter any bugs, feel free to file a report or a PR!
