Aurora Installer
================

This script installs and upgrades 64-bit Firefox Aurora on Ubuntu Linux systems using Mozilla's binaries

Why?
----
The Aurora PPA is always slow to publish whenever a new 6-week cycle of Aurora development kicks off.  That, in addition to the fact that Canonical's Firefox builds always misbehave, made me put this script together.

What does it do?
----------------
This:

1. Closes all open instances of Firefox
2. Downloads the most recent x64 Aurora build
3. Installs it to /opt/firefox (creating a backup at /opt/firefox-old just in case something's wrong with that day's build)
4. Links the new instance of Firefox to the system Firefox's plugin directory.
5. Renames your system Firefox to `firefox-system` and takes over the `firefox` command.

You should be able to run this repeatedly without issue. If you encounter any bugs, feel free to file a report or a PR!
